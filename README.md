# How to use databases effectively based on the research on bibliographic databases
In this document, I discuss two articles about the coverage of different bibliographic databases. I present and discuss two different views on how to use the databases effectively.

## Article 1
In the article [Where you search determines what you find: the effects of bibliographic databases on systematic reviews](https://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2021.1892378) by _Seperia B. Wanyama, Ronald W. McQuaid and Markus Kittler_, the authors argue that the result of searching will be affected by the choice of bibliographic databases. They drew into the conclusion that people should use multiple databases instead of one single database when searching for literature.

According to the article, there's evidence of huge difference between three large electronic databases, Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO when studying about employee retention and turnover. They found that among all the retrieved articles, only 5.7% of the articles can be found in all these three databases, which is a really small amount. Therefore, more databases are needed when searching. It also provides systematic reviews with some advices on how to make it better.

## Article 2
In the article [Search where you will find most: Comparing the disciplinary coverage of 56 bibliographic databases](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-022-04289-7) by _Michael Gusenbauer_, the author introduces a new scientometrics method and uses it to compare the ranges coverage of various search engines, repositories, digital libraries, and other bibliographic databases. The conclusion is that when people search for articles and literature, they should use more comprehensive databases.

Contrary to article 1, this article chooses a larger database instead of more databases. People would be able to have searches with high percision and profession if they have knowledge about the subject coverage of the databases. Besides, BOK method is very useful in finding the ranking of the coverages of different scholarly databases, which is very helpful since they both quantify a textual description of coverage but also facilitate comparisons of subject coverage. By using of various methods, peoplw should use the database with the largest coverage.
